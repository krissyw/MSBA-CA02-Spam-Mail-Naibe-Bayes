# MSBA-CA02-Spam-Mail-Naibe-Bayes
MSBA Computer Assignment 01 - Spam Mail Detection by Naive Bayes

The sample code and dataset are downloaded from https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA01-Spam-Mail-Naibe-Bayes.

I constructed my own Google Colab Notebook using my own variables and provided comments and print statements to 
understand the process at every step. 

# Instructions to download the data and code
1. First click on the "Data.zip" as shown in the screenshot below.

7. Once the code is saved as a .py, it can be opened with BBEdit on a Mac or another text editor software. 

# Install packages 

This notebook installs the following packages:
- os
- numpy
- Counter from collections
- GaussianNB from sklearn.naive_bayes
- accuracy_score from sklean.metrics

The data files containing test and train data on emails were put into the same Google Drive folder that contains 
the Google Colab Notebook.
